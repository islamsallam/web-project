<h1> How Do All-Electric Cars Work? </h1>

<p> All-electric vehicles (EVs), also referred to as battery electric vehicles, have an electric motor instead of an internal combustion engine. The vehicle uses a large traction battery pack to power the electric motor and must be plugged in to a wall outlet or charging equipment, also called electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE). Because it runs on electricity, the vehicle emits no exhaust from a tailpipe and does not contain the typical liquid fuel components, such as a fuel pump, fuel line, or fuel tank.

<tr>
<td> Battery (all-electric auxiliary </td>
<td>  In an electric drive vehicle, the auxiliary battery provides electricity to power vehicle accessories.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td> Charge port</td>
<td> The charge port allows the vehicle to connect to an external power supply in order to charge the traction battery pack. </td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td> DC/DC converter </td>
<td>  This device converts higher-voltage DC power from the traction battery pack to the lower-voltage DC power needed to run vehicle accessories and recharge the auxiliary battery. </td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td> Electric traction motor</td>
<td>  Using power from the traction battery pack, this motor drives the vehicle's wheels. Some vehicles use motor generators that perform both the drive and regeneration functions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Onboard charger </td>
<td> Takes the incoming AC electricity supplied via the charge port and converts it to DC power for charging the traction battery. It also communicates with the charging equipment and monitors battery characteristics such as voltage, current, temperature, and state of charge while charging the pack.</td>
